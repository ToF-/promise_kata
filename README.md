a kata on callbacks, promises, async and await

Write, test first, a node programs which
- fetches a fact about cats, keeping track of the length L
- then fetches 3 other facts about cats that are shorter than L

( idea : asynchronous calls with dependency between the calls )

- First using callbacks.

- Then using Promises, with then and catch.

- Then using async and await.
